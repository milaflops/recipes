# Recipes
## An Iterative Approach

This is my collection of recipes, including modifications that I make. I think git + github is a good tool for tracking changes and modifications over time.

## Current Recipes

### [Beef Stew](beef_stew.md)
A nice stew that my best friend made one time, I've since modified it

### [Chickpea Salad](chickpea_salad.md)
A refreshing side dish, perfect for a picnic, or a night at Cinespia.
