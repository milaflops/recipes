# Chickpea Salad

Refreshing, cold, super easy to prepare. It'll last about a week in the fridge, but will probably get eaten way before then. I usually quadruple the recipe, so I've included those quantities as well.

There's lots of wiggle room with the measurements here.

### Equipment
- Bowl or storage container 
- Knife, cutting board
- Measuring spoons and cups

### Ingredients

| Quantity      | 4x Quantity         | Ingredient                   |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 15oz (1 can)  | ~40oz (4 cans)      | Chickpeas                    |
| 2 Tbsp        | 1/2 Cup             | Chopped Fresh Basil          |
| 2 Tbsp        | 1/2 Cup             | Chopped Parsley              |
| 2 Tbsp        | 1/2 Cup             | Lemon Juice                  |
| 8 tsp         | 2/3 Cup             | Olive Oil (extra virgin)     |
| 2 cloves      | 8 cloves            | Garlic (finely minced)       |
| 1/3 Cup       | 1 1/2 Cup           | Shaved Parmesan              |
| 1 tsp         | 4 tsp               | Kosher Salt                  |


### Directions

1. **Prepare** the ingredients, if you have not already. **Wash**, **chop**, **mince**, **measure**, etc.
1. **Combine** ingredients in a large bowl.
1. **Toss** with a spatula to coat the chickpeas. The olive oil will absorb the spices, so give it time.
1. **Chill** in fridge before serving. This dish is best cold.

### Notes

#### Garlic
- Feel free to go wild with the garlic.
- Make sure it's chopped small enough, as it won't be cooked, large chunks can be jarring to the palate.
- I've been meaning to experiment with roasting the garlic first. It might take out some of the raw bite, and make the dish safer.

#### Parmesan
I prefer shaved here, as it helps constitute the mouthfeel of this salad, and grated cheese tends to stick around in the bowl.

#### Kosher Salt
I add this to taste, so measurements are rough. It'll dissolve, of course, so use any salt you want if Kosher isn't available.
