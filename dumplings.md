# Dumplings

A starter recipe that we plan to iterate on. Currently this is very basic, but delicious!

### Ingredients

| Quantity     | Ingredient         |
| ------------ | -----------------: |
| 1.5lbs       | Ground Meat        |
| 7 Tbsp       | Soy Sauce          |
| 5 Tbsp       | Rice Wine          |
| 2 Tbsp       | Mirin              |
| 10 "shakes"  | White Pepper       |
| 1.5 Tbsp     | Ginger (minced)    |
| 1.5 Tbsp     | Garlic (minced)    |
| 1 bunch      | Green Onions       |
| 9 Leaves     | Cabbage            |
| 60-100       | Dumpling Wrappers  |

### Directions

1. **Prepare** the ingredients - **mince** the Ginger and Garlic, **chop** the Green Onions and Cabbage very finely.
1. **Mix** everything except the dumpling wrappers in a large pot or bowl, until ingredients are spread evenly.
1. **Wrap** the dumplings - place a small dollop of the meat mix in the center of a wrapper, and fold the wrapper over until the dumpling is sealed. Use pleats to create the dumpling shape. If adhesion is difficult, wet with water to help the wrapper stick to itself, and squeeze the end of the wrapper until it's sealed shut.
    - Note: This doesn't need to be super pretty, the important part is that the dumpling is sealed. It's all going to taste the same anyway.
1. **Boil** the dumplings in water (rolling boil) until they float, probably at least 10 minutes. Check internal temperature to make sure it's safe for the type of meat you've used.
1. Allow to cool, and **serve**!!

Someone we know makes dumplings by eyeballing the ingredients, and we asked her to estimate the quantities used so we could have a nice starting point. We made these for the first time, and used ground chicken. It turned out great!

We served this with a sauce by mixing minced garlic, soy sauce, sesame oil, a bit of vinegar, green onions, and chili oil. This sauce was delicious! I definitely used a lot more chili oil for mine.

This recipe probably makes 60-100 dumplings?? We're still calibrating! Next time, we probably want more garlic + pepper + vegetables.
