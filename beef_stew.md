# Beef Stew

This is a savory and hearty warm meal for those who enjoy food. It can be adapted with low risk of catastrophic failure, and is a good beginner dish for people who do not know anything about cooking (like me). I got the original recipe it from my best friend who made it while we were living together on a tight budget.

### Ingredients

| Quantity   | Thing                    |
| ---------- |-------------------------:|
| 2 lbs.     | Beef Stew Meat           |
| 1/4 cup    | All-purpose Flour        |
| 1 tbsp.    | Ground Black Pepper      |
| 1 tsp.     | Cayenne Pepper           |
| 1/2 tsp.   | Iodized Salt             |
| 1 bulb     | Garlic                   |
| 1 tsp.     | Paprika                  |
| 1 tbsp.    | Worcestershire Sauce     |
| 1          | Bay Leaf                 |
| 1          | Whole Onion              |
| 2          | Potatoes, diced          |
| 4          | Carrots, sliced          |
| 2          | Stalks celery, chopped   |

### Directions

* `Place` meat in slow cooker.
* In small bowl, `mix` the flour, salt, and pepper.
* `Stir` this into meat to `coat` with flour mixture.
* `Stir` in the rest of the stuff
* `Cover`, and `cook` on Low for 10 to 12 hours, or on High for 4 to 6 hours.

### Comments

#### First Batch

I cooked it slightly differently from the original recipe:
* I increased the Garlic tenfold to a whole bulb (to ward off vampires)
* I decreased the amount of potatoes to 2 because my crock pot was not big enough to handle the sheer volume
* I chose gluten-free all-purpose flour. I think this was a good choice, as gluten is useless here

The results were good, and the stew was flavorful. The potatoes, however, were too soft after cooking for 12 hours, and made the broth pretty thick and starchy.
