# Beef Stew

This is a savory and hearty warm meal for those who enjoy food. It can be adapted with low risk of catastrophic failure, and is a good beginner dish for people who do not know anything about cooking (like me). I got the original recipe it from my best friend who made it while we were living together on a tight budget.

### Ingredients

| Quantity   | Thing                    |
| ---------- |-------------------------:|
| 2 lbs      | Beef Stew Meat           |
| 1/4 cup    | All-purpose Flour        |
| 1 tbsp     | Ground Black Pepper      |
| 1 tsp      | Cayenne Pepper           |
| 1/2 tsp    | Iodized Salt             |
| 1 1/2 cup  | Beef Broth               |
| 1 bulb     | Garlic                   |
| 1 tsp      | Paprika                  |
| 1 Tbsp     | Worcestershire Sauce     |
| 1          | Bay Leaf                 |
| 1          | Whole Onion              |
| 2          | Potatoes, diced          |
| 4          | Carrots, sliced          |
| 2          | Stalks celery, chopped   |

### Directions

* `Place` meat in slow cooker.
* In small bowl, `mix` the flour, salt, and pepper.
* `Stir` this into meat to `coat` with flour mixture.
* `Stir` in the rest of the stuff
* `Cover`, and `cook` on Low for 10 to 12 hours, or on High for 4 to 6 hours.

### Comments

#### First Batch

I cooked it slightly differently from the original recipe:
* I increased the Garlic tenfold to a whole bulb (to ward off vampires)
* I decreased the amount of potatoes to 2 because my crock pot was not big enough to handle the sheer volume
* I chose gluten-free all-purpose flour. I think this was a good choice, as gluten is useless here

The results were good, and the stew was flavorful. The potatoes, however, were too soft after cooking for 12 hours, and made the broth pretty thick and starchy.

#### Second Batch

Changing a few things this time:
* Adding Cayenne to the pepper mix because it is delicious.
* Increasing the amount of black pepper and Worcestershire sauce
* Adding the potatoes halfway through to prevent them becoming too soft

I accidentally put way too much Worcestershire (much more than 1Tbsp, I think) as I do not have measuring spoons. I'll keep it at 1Tbsp for now.
I also put way too much garlic after discovering I had Garlic Powder to substitute, and incorrectly assuming it is equal in flavor effects to minced garlic by volume. This is potent stuff.
I also chopped the onions up into half-rings instead of tiny little shards. This is a neat effect but I don't know how I feel about it.
The rest of it was good, and I'll decrease the potato cooking time even more for next batch.
