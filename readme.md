## An Iterative Approach

My personal collection of recipes, including modifications that I make. The aim is to be a mirror of my paper recipes, for remote lookup, backup, and sharing purposes. Eventually I'll add my bookmarked online recipes, as I've lost more than a few of those to link rot.

## Current Recipes

### [Beef Stew](beef_stew.md)
A nice stew that my best friend made one time, I've since modified it

### [Chickpea Salad](chickpea_salad.md)
A refreshing side dish, perfect for a picnic, or a night at Cinespia.

### [Dumplings](dumplings.md)
Simple and easy to cook. Takes about 1-2 hours, disappears in minutes.
