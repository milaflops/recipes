# Beef Stew

This is a savory and hearty warm meal for those who enjoy food. It can be adapted with low risk of catastrophic failure, and is a good beginner dish for people who do not know anything about cooking (like me). I got the original recipe it from my best friend who made it while we were living together on a tight budget.

### Equipment
- Slow Cooker, 6 qt or larger

### Ingredients

| Quantity   | Thing                    | Substitute                   |
| ---------- | -----------------------: | ---------------------------- |
| 2 lbs      | Beef Stew Meat           |                              |
| 1/4 cup    | All-purpose Flour        |                              |
| 2 tsp      | Ground Black Pepper      |                              |
| 1/2 tsp    | Cayenne Pepper           |                              |
| 1/2 tsp    | Iodized Salt             |                              |
| 2 cups     | Beef Broth               |                              |
| 1 head     | Garlic, Minced           | 1 tsp Garlic Powder          |
| 1 tsp      | Paprika                  |                              |
| 1 Tbsp     | Worcestershire Sauce     |                              |
| 1          | Bay Leaf                 | 2 Dried Bay Leafs            |
| 1          | Whole Onion              |                              |
| 4          | Carrots, sliced          | 1 bag Baby Carrots, Sliced   |
| 2          | Heads celery, chopped    | 3 heads if you want          |
| 2          | Potatoes, diced          | 2 Potatoes, diced and peeled |

### Directions

1. `Cut` beef stew meat into ~1" cubes.
1. In small bowl, `sift` the flour, salt, and pepper together.
1. `Coat` the beef cubes in this floured mixture and stir until evenly coated. You can use a large bowl and a spatula, or just use your hands lol.
1. `Place` the beef cubes in bottom of slow cooker.
1. `Pour` in the broth, and add each subsequent ingredient over that, ending up with the potatoes on top. This lets the carrots and celery simmer and keeps the potatoes from getting soggy. Don't stir!
1. `Cover`, and `cook` on Low for 10 to 12 hours, or on High for 4 to 6 hours.

### CHANGELOG

#### nth Batch (February 2019)

- 1 Tbsp of pepper is too much. I've decreased this to 2 tsp
- There wasn't enough celery. I've increased this to 2 heads (will use 3 heads this time because that's what I have)
- Added a substitute column for alternate ingredients
- Added back Bay Leaf, and added substitute for dried bay leaf

#### Third Batch

- Bought actual measuring spoons. Will do everything as accurately as possible.
- Increased beef broth as well (2 cups is also half a container, convenient!).

Results: Best beef stew yet. Potential future improvements:
- *Add back bay leaf? How about dried bay leaf? Does such a thing exist?*
- *Decrease cayenne (half?)*
- *Increase celery - if I'm buying celery anyway, it's worth including more (3 stalks?)*

#### Second Batch

- Added Cayenne to the pepper mix because it is delicious.
- Increased the amount of black pepper and Worcestershire sauce
- Adding the potatoes halfway through to prevent them becoming too soft

I accidentally put way too much Worcestershire (much more than 1Tbsp, I think) as I do not have measuring spoons. It was ridiculously worchestershirey.
I also put way too much garlic after discovering I had Garlic Powder to substitute, and incorrectly assuming it is equal in flavor effects to minced garlic by volume. This is potent stuff.
I also chopped the onions up into half-rings instead of tiny little shards. This is a neat effect but I don't know how I feel about it.
The rest of it was good, and I'll decrease the potato cooking time even more for next batch.

#### First Batch

I cooked it slightly differently from the original recipe:
- I increased the Garlic tenfold to a whole bulb (to ward off vampires)
- I decreased the amount of potatoes to 2 because my crock pot was not big enough to handle the sheer volume
- I chose gluten-free all-purpose flour. I think this was a good choice, as gluten is useless here

The results were good, and the stew was flavorful. The potatoes, however, were too soft after cooking for 12 hours, and made the broth pretty thick and starchy.
